SIO2Arduino is an open-source implementation of the Atari SIO device protocol that runs on Arduino hardware. Arduino hardware is open-source and can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled.

This fork does not require any additional libraries.  It should work delightfully well with the base SD library included with current Arduino SDKs.  This change may also fix some issues with certain SD card hats that may not have worked under the older libraries.
